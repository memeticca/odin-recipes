        <h1 class="title">Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, plus more for pan</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup sweetened flaked coconut</li>

        <h1 class="title">Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring milk and butter to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Continue to cook, stirring often,
                until the milk has reduced to half and thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in the 1/4
                cup coconut, and allow to cool a bit before pouring into a buttered bowl. Chill in the refrigerator
                until cold, about 2 hours.</li>

            <li>With buttered or oiled hands, form milk mixture into tablespoon-sized balls, and roll in coconut flakes.
                Stick a clove into each beijinho as decoration.</li>
        </ol>
